=== Running CUTLASS GEMM ===
CUTLASS GEMM: 0.93993 ms (avg of 10 runs), 146223 TFLOPS
Result checksum: 2702.48

=== CUTLASS Analysis ===
- Programming Model: Template metaprogramming with C++ templates
- Implementation: Highly configurable GEMM template library
- Memory Hierarchy: Explicit layout and tiling specification
- Parallelism: Architecture-specific warp/thread orchestration
- Tiling Strategy: 128x128x32 threadblock, 64x64x32 warp, 16x8x16 instruction
- Algorithm: Optimized for Ampere architecture (SM80)
- Precision: Mixed precision (FP16 input, FP32 accumulation)
